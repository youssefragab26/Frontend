// Logical AND operator: && 

// The logical AND operator is, for example, used to confirm if multiple comparisons will return true.
// The logical AND operator returns true if both the operands are true.
// In JavaScript, this operator consists of two ampersand symbols together: &&.

// Let's say you're tasked with coming up with some code that will check if the currentTime variable is between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m.
// The code needs to console.log true if currentTime > 9 and if currentTime < 17.

let currentTime = 10;
console.log(currentTime > 9 && currentTime < 17);

let gameScore = 40;
console.log(gameScore > 30 && gameScore < 50);



// Logical OR operator: || 

// Logical NOT operator: ! 

// The modulus operator: % 

// The equality operator: ==

// The strict equality operator: ===

// The inequality operator: !=

// The strict inequality operator: !==

// The addition assignment operator: += 

// The concatenation assignment operator: += (it's the same as the previous one - more on that later)
